If he has conjugal relations with her, that will be considered as zina (adultery). He has no value to his name. He will not be allowed to marry anyone, whether she is a Muslim, non-Muslim or anyone. If his wife becomes pregnant after that time, the child will not be attributed to him. Anything he slaughters will be deemed harām. Any game he hunts will be impermissible.[1] Those around him will disown him.[2] He will not be entitled to zakāt funds or sadaqah al-fitr no matter how desperate he maybe. If he dies, he will not be washed or shrouded, nor will he be deserving of the ritual wash (ghusl).[3] It will not be permissible to attend his funeral procession.[4] His estate will not be distributed amongst his family.

All my life I have been living on a hope that one day Allāh would reward me for keeping my virginity safe, so where is my reward? What should I do? I’m so confused. Is there any specific dua that could heal this complicated disease in me? I don’t like the way I look because the medicines side effects burnt my skin and lost my hair. What can I do to get my beauty back so that I can get married soon? Is there any dua for that? Please help me. I wish there was a way to communicate with Allāh, but that’s just not possible.",

My question is whether it is acceptable to do that whenever faced with a problem or will it be considered as shrik/innovation as the Quran was not sent for this purpose.

Earlier, Yaqub (alayhis salaam) had said “sabrun jamîl,” which means “patience is most fitting for me.” The Quran also tells us about Ayyub (alayhis salaam): “And (remember) Ayyub, when he cried to his Lord, ‘Truly distress has seized me...’ ” (Al-Anbiya 21:83). The epitome of patience, the Prophet (salallhu alayhi wa sallam), prayed to his Lord: “O Allâh, I complain to You of my weakness and helplessness.”1"

Again when he drew closer and there was barely the distance of two or three spear-lengths between us, I said, 'This seeker has caught up with us, O Rasulullah!' (And again) I began to cry. Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم enquired, 'What is causing you to cry?' I replied, 'By the oath of Allah, I am not crying due to fear for myself, rather, I am crying for your sake (I am concerned about your safety).' Thereafter, Rasulullah صلى الله عليه و سلم cursed Suraqah saying, 'O Allah! Suffice us as You will against him!'

The support system normally received from family and friends is nonexistent. The years of Islamic values learned as a child and witnessed in the home are not there. Bearing these factors in mind, you must be very sensitive when encouraging your wife. Positive reinforcement is usually more effective then being negative. There will definitely be ups and downs, but as I mentioned earlier, patience and understanding is a must. If you force your wife to do certain actions, she may do it in the beginning, but chances are she will eventually abandon those same actions. If you give her time and a chance to develop and strengthen her īmān, adopting the Islamic practices at her own pace, then, insha Allah, there will be permanence in her practice. It will take time for her to get used to this new way of life. There is nothing wrong with that. Many of us have spent our whole life as Muslims and we still do not do what we are supposed to. Your main concern should be that her faith is not wavered. The first few years upon accepting Islam are usually the most critical. It is usually during this time that a person decides to continue as a Muslim or revert back to their old ways. Ensure that her faith is established and, if that happens, everything else will slowly fall into place insha Allah."

She needs a secondary source encouragement from someone besides you. In the meantime, give your marriage a chance. Implement some of the advice rendered here and remove the thought of divorce from your mind and the word divorce from your vocabulary. She is counting on you to be her primary means of guidance, even if it is indirectly. Make lots of du‘ā because ultimately Allah is the doer of everything and nothing can happen without His permission.

We as muslims believe that in the end we all go to heaven. And our Prophet (SAW) has promised us that. I have read a hadith where our Prophet (SAW) has mentioned that the one who believes in Allah as the only Creator, this belief alone will take him to heaven. His companions and at one place He himself did not want this to be made public out of worry over the fact that the people would leave all righteous practices on the belief that they're destined to heaven already. What exactly was meant by the headith? Additionally whenever we read Quran, there are words announcing victory for 'those who believe and do the righteous deeds'...\n2. We Muslims believe in Allah being the sole Creator and the only worthiest of being worshipped...and that Prophet (SAW) is his last messenger. A person in the present world who believes in the first part alone and somehow is not aware of the last part, say the Jews and Christians, or maybe not belonging to any religion yet believes in One Creator, will he be destined to heaven?\n3.

      "Question": "My question is complicated but inshallah you can guide me. I have been engaged for many years, im 23 and my fiancee lives in another country. Somehow my heart fell for another and after sometime we began to commit zina. At the time i was oblivious to islams teachings and blindly this carried on for sometime. I think as a punishment from allah my finacee who used to love me an enourmous amount began to have doubts about us as he became more and more religious he said 'i dont know why but i dont think we should get married'. I now know what i have done was so wrong, my fiancee is very pious muslim but the other man smokes, drinks, smokes asheesh has slpet with other women and is a constant liar i have found out, he also has a son and a wife who he hates. He is also very violent when i tell him i dont want to see him anymore. I feel im lost, i want to be a good muslim, i pray for iman and taqwaa from allah, i have begun praying 5 times now and i pray that i wont lose my fiancée but i dont understand how i still want to see the other man even though i know how bad he is.",

They also mention that there is no clear mention of how the al-Lawh al-Mahfuz is in appearance; however, we know it does in fact exist since Allah Ta’ala has made mention of it in the Quran. The exact appearance of al-Lawh al-Mahfuz is from amongst the things only known to Allah Ta’ala himself. What we do know about it is that indeed all things are pre-written in it and that the Quran is protected within it. To know how the al-Lawh al-Mahfuz is in appearance should not affect ones’ iman in any way since there are many things we are made unaware of yet we still believe in their existence."

The companions of the Prophet (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam) preserved every aspect of the life of our beloved Prophet (SalAllahu Alayhi Wasallam). Surely, they would not have left out any special practice or worship that was to be done on this night.

The summary of the hadith is something like our prophet, peace be up on him, one day, was telling one of the companion that after the sun sets it reaches near to arsh , humbles to God and seek permission to rise again. We know that the sun never sets. It is the matter of the motion of earth in accordance with science.

One should spend these nights in offering Salaat, reciting the Holy Quran, listening to the recitation of the Holy Quran, reading and listening to ahaadith, zikrullah (remembrance of Allah), salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam), making dua, etc. One should endeavor to spend the majority of the night doing the abovementioned things. If majority of the night is difficult, then for however long he can. However, to get together in the masjid during these nights for the purpose of staying awake at night and worshipping is not permissible as it was not the practice of Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) nor of the Sahabah (Radiyallahu Anhum). Rasulullah (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa Sallam) said, ‘One who offers Isha salaat in jama’ah (congregation) is as if he spent half the night in worship, and the one who offers Fajr salaat is jama’ah is as if he spent the whole night in worship.’ (Muslim, hadith no. 1049).

      "Question": "As Salamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu Mufti Ebrahim Desai\nI have received an e-mail below from a friend which I require clarification regarding the use of the term Maulana for our learned scholars. I have always thought that the word “Moulana “meant guide and as the Alims are our guide the term was appropriate.\nLinguistically Maula means protector, helper, and supporter.\nI am not an Alim and look forward to your comments and feedback. I would appreciate it very much Jazakallahu Khairan. I will forward your response to my friend to clarify the issue.\n- Questioner...\nE mail Received:As Salamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa BarakatuhuAs I mentioned to you, sometime ago I did a Qur'an search on the word Maula – it is difficult to search Arabic words because the pronouns form part of the word. You will notice that most of the time this word refers to Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala and in one place to the Fire and in one place as a master in the parable of the slave and master, in one place to idols and in one place to near relativesIf you study these Ayah with the word “Maula” in their context mentioned Qur'an you will find that Maulana – Our Protector is a term we should only use for Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala and none other. If you take the example you quoted from Surah Ad-Dukhan, you will realize that except Allah none one can be our Maula not even our near relatives. That’s my understanding of that Ayah.Here are the Ayah:Maulana –our MaulaYou are our Protector, give us victory over the disbelievers (Surah Al-Baqarah 2: 286)Say: \"Nothing shall ever happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is our Mawla (protector).'' And in Allah let the believers put their trust. (Surah At-Taubah 9: 51)Maulahu - his MaulaIf you two turn in repentance to Allah, your hearts are indeed so inclined; but if you help one another against him, then verily, Allah is his Protector, and Jibril, and the righteous among the believers; and after that the angels are his helpers. (Surah At-Tahrim 66:4)And Allah gives an example of two men, one of them dumb, who has no power over anything, and he is a burden on his (Maula) master; whichever way he directs him, he brings no good. Is such a man equal to one who commands justice, and is himself on the straight path. (Surah An-Nahl 16: 76)Mujahid said, \"This also refers to idols and the True God, may He be exalted.'' Meaning that the idol is dumb and cannot speak or say anything, good or otherwise. It cannot do anything at all, no words, no action, it is dependent and is a burden on its master. (Tafsir ibn Kathir)Maulahum- their MaulaThen they are returned to Allah, their Master, the Just Lord. Surely, His is the judgment and He is the swiftest in taking account. (Surah Al-An’am 6: 62)There! Every person will know (exactly) what he had earned before and they will be brought back to Allah, their rightful Mawla (Lord), and their invented false deities will vanish from them.) (Surah Yunus 10: 30)Maulakum- your Maula (plural)Allah has already ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths. And Allah is your Protector and He is the All-Knower, the All-Wise. (Surah At-Tahrim 66: 2)Nay, Allah is your protector, and He is the best of helpers. (Surah Al-Imran 3: 150)And if they turn away, then know that Allah is your protector -- (what) an excellent protector and (what) an excellent helper! (Surah Al-Anfal 8: 40)And strive hard in Allah's cause as you ought to strive. He has chosen you, and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship: it is the religion of your father Ibrahim.He has named you Muslims both before and in this (Qur'an), that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind! So, perform the Salah, give the Zakah and hold fast to Allah. He is your Mawla, what an Excellent Mawla and what an Excellent Helper! (Surah Al-Hajj 22: 78)So, this Day no ransom shall be taken from you, nor of those who disbelieved. Your abode is the Fire. That is your protector, and worst indeed is that destination. (Surah Al-Hadid 57: 15)(Your abode is the Fire.) means, the Fire is your final destination and to it will be your return for residence,(That is your protector,) meaning, it is the worthy shelter for you rather than any other residence, because of your disbelief and doubt, and how evil is the Fire for Final Destination. (Tafsir ibn Kathir)This Ayah is a stern warning that we should not make the Fire our Protector in the Akhirah.Maula and the Maula (Protector and The Protector)Surah Al-Anfal 8: 40 (Mentioned above) an excellent protector here refers to none other than Allah.He calls unto him whose harm is nearer than his profit; certainly an evil Mawla (Protector) and certainly an evil `Ashir. (Surah Al-Hajj 22: 13)(certainly an evil Mawla and certainly an evil `Ashir!) Mujahid said, \"This means the idols.'' The meaning is: \"How evil a friend is this one upon whom he calls instead of Allah as a helper and supporter.'' (Tafsir ibn Kathir)Another warning making idols our MaulaThe Day when a Maula (near relative) cannot avail a Maula (near relative) in aught, and no help can they receive. (Surah Ad-Dukhan 44: 41)This meaning is very clear none can protect us (be our Maula) on that day except Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’alaThat is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, whereas the disbelievers have no protector. (Surah Muhammad 47: 11)I could not research this word in the Ahadith as I don’t have the Hadith in Arabic, only English, so it is hard to say what word was used for protector, helper etc.My conclusion is that in the Glorious Qur'an Maula refers mainly to Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala, yes there are other meanings to word like helper, supporter, master, I accept that. Even so I feel instead of using Maulana for an Islamic teacher or scholar, to stay way from using a term when there is a doubt. It is better not to use this term, instead use Ustad or Mu’allim, Shaikh, Molvi these terms don’t refer to Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala.How often we read the last two Ayah of Surah Al-Baqarah, in fact we are told to pray those two Ayah every night ………Anta Maulana……….Allah you are Maulana.But then again I am not a scholar, but my heart and inner feelings tell me not to use this term for our religious teachers and scholars.The point I am trying to make - lets refrain from using terms which may or may not lead us to commit Shirk……..this would be a minor Shirk like the Prophet (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam) warned us about the minor shirks which we are not aware of like doing things to show off to people – Ar-Riya or a major Shirk like making our scholars our protectors – Allah forbid.And going back to the example of Rabb you mentioned in the meeting - do we find people calling themselves Rabbana Ibrahim so and so; no we don’t. Yes Rabb is the meaning of Lord. Rabbal-Musa – the Lord of Musa but Rabbana-ONLY Allah. Another good example I can think of is Nabi’ena = Our Prophet whenever we say Nabi’ena we are referring to Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam) and no one else. When we say Nabi’ena Ibrahim or Musa it okay because they are our Prophets too– but when we use Nabí’ena by itself we are referring to no other than our Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam). Correct me if I am wrong.Dear Brother Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala has blessed you with immense knowledge of HIS DEEN and put you in a gifted position to service Islam and the Muslims, don’t let others equate to you His Level by calling you Maulana. You are not our Maulana Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala is. May Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala protect us from ourselves. Ameen!Sori for this long email, I know you will share this email with others so I tried to be as thorough as I could. If I made a mistake I would appreciate it, if for the sake and blessings from Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala you will point it out to me. Insha Allah. Since I am not a scholar only a student and my knowledge of Arabic is also very limited, I would be wrong in my understanding and reasoning.Anything good I have written is entirely thru the Grace and Mercy of Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala and errors I made are entirely my fault and thru the whisperings of Shaitan.May Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala help us to understand His Deen and worship Him according to His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger (Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam) Ameen!Wa Alaikum Salam wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu",

This is similar to their incorrect belief of Allāh physically sitting on the 'Arsh. This implies that the laws and restrictions of physical space (makān) also apply to Allāh and that He has a body, both concepts which have been rejected by scholars of all times. This concept will lead one to question where Allāh was before He created the 'Arsh. Obviously, Allāh existed before the 'Arsh and was never confined to the area of the 'Arsh. Our belief is that Allāh is as He was before the creation of the 'Arsh. Therefore, it is necessary to interpret such hādīths and ayāhs to understand them correctly."

I know that ignorance in matters of Deen will not be considered an excuse. One such statement which I had made has been bothering me for some time.

I attributed a quality of forgetfulness that is found in human beings to Allah subhanwataala. Am I guilty of kufr?\nIf yes, then I understand that I have to renew my nikah in front of two witnesses. Can these witnesses me my uncle or male cousins? What would be the status of my children born until now?",

      "Question": "Salaams, I was talking to a non-Muslim friend of mine who comes from a Christian background. He was wondering about the theological background regarding Adam (pbuh) and Eve and \"original sin.\" I know that concept does not count in Islam because we are all responsible for our own sins and we do not need a savior, however I was unable to answer his question because I was not aware of the theological perspective of Adams descent on earth. I was wondering if you could answer this question. I know that Adam was always meant to be sent down to earth, but was he sent down on earth because he ate the forbidden fruit? My friend further questioned why we all weren't born with Allah because we are all born without sin, and why we are all \"punished\" to live on earth for Adam's sin. If Adam was not sent on earth because of the fruit, was there a reason that Allah chose that moment to send Adam on earth? My friend believed that God would not \"act out of whim\" like that. I know Allah has His reasons for everything, but I was wondering the Islamic theological perspective of this concept. JazakAllah Khair for all your help Walaikum Salaams -Sarah",

I have stopped watching movies a long time ago, and just to mention I have, Alhamdulillah, memorized the Holy Quran. I have scary thoughts about Jinns, ghosts, murderers, etc. Is it permissible to have these fears because I am sure that the only one to fear is Allah SWT. I try to get rid of these thoughts but to no avail. I get scared to sleep by myself and go to the bathroom just because of these fears, and at my age of 16 I should not be having all this fright. Is there any way to stop this nonsense in my mind?\n2. There is a new type of music on the market called iMusic. I understand and believe in your position on music, however this type of music refrains from any human voices. Also, the special thing about it is that it is supposed to boost brain power. Would this attribute make it permissible?\nJazaakAllah Khair",

The Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wa-Sallaam) was informed of many things, such as conditions of the grave, jannah, jahanam, hashr, and many other things of the unseen. Yet, this was not complete knowledge of the unseen. Rather, only selected knowledge that Allah (Subhanahu WaTa’ala) chose to grant him. The fact that the Prophet (SalAllahu Alahi Wassalaam) did not have complete knowledge of the unseen is proven through many ayaat of the Quran, they are as follows:"

The first was when Aishah (RadiyAllahu Anha) was falsely accused of immodesty. This accusation caused the Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wa-Sallaam) a lot of discomfort and worried him excessively due to which he made mashwarah with the Sahabah (RadiAllahu Anhum). Eventually, Allah (Subhanahu WaTa’ala) informed him through wahy of the purity and innocence of Aishah (RadiAllahu Anha). This revelation of the wahy comforted the Prophet (SallAllah Alayhi Wa-Sallaam) immensely, and shows that he was not aware of the reality of the situation until Allah (Subhanahu WaTa’ala) decided to inform him of it. If the Prophet (SallAllahu Alayhi Wa-Sallaam) has complete knowledge of the unseen he would have known that the accusation was false and would not have needed to do mashwarah with the Sahabah (RadiyAllahu Anhum).

This delay was when no water was available and they were required to make Tayammum in order to offer their prayer. Eventually, when one of the camels was made to stand, the necklace was found under the camel. Again, this shows us that the Prophet (SalAllahu Alahi Wassalaam) did not have knowledge of the unseen. If he did, in fact have the knowledge of the unseen, then he surely would not have allowed the delay, especially when they did not have any water to offer their Salah. (Mahmoodiya)"

They also read something called fatiha on food. if you know to know what that is is its makind dua in front of food on a special day like a pious person death day and they read surah fatiha then ikhlaas falaq and naas and then they say to send the reward to that person. i want to know if this is allowed and also can the other stuff i mentioned.

None, besides Allah, knows the actual nature of the connection. However, there is the sun and the moon in the sky, but their rays fall on the earth and provide to it light and heat. Similarly, the souls of Illiyeen and Sijjeen may have some spiritual connection with the graves (Tafseer Mazhari vol. 10 pg. 196 Maktaba Hanafiya). In Surah Naazi’aat, Qadhi Thana’ullah discusses some aspects of the soul, the total sum of which is as follows: There are two types of soul: The one is a subtle substance that permeates the human body. Despite being a material substance, it is too subtle to be visible, and its other name is nafs. The other soul is abstract and non-material, pure essence. The pure, abstract and non-material soul is the life of the first soul, and therefore it is called the ‘soul of soul’. Both the categories of souls are connected to human body, but the first type of soul resides in the human body. When the soul leaves the body, death occurs. The second type of soul is connected with the body more closely than the first type, but Allah alone knows the nature of the connection. The first soul, after death, is taken to the heaven, and then returned to the grave. Grave is its abode where it is rewarded and punished. The abstract soul remains in Illiyeen or Sijjeen (Tafseer Mazhari vol. 10 pg. 155)."

      "Title": "i have just visited a barelvi wbsit on which they have made objection on tableeghi and deoband jamat. the links are as follow...",
      "Question": "salam\ni have just visited a barelvi wbsit on which they have made objection on tableeghi and deoband jamat. the links are as follow\nhttp://www.islamicacademy.org/index.htm\nhttp://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/Black and White.htm\nhttp://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/Tableeghee Jma at-Ahadis.htm\nhttp://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Articles/English/Tableeghee Jma at.htm\nsome of the objections are as follow. please clear these points as they are confusing me a lot. i have inclined to deoband and tableegh just 2 or 3 years back.\nTo have good and strong Imaan, one must have the proper Aqeeda. It is for this reason that we quote a few un-Islamic beliefs of the leaders of the Tableeghi Jamaat together with the proper Islamic answers. The present Molvis and devotees of the T. Jamaat refuse to condemn the persons who wrote such bad beliefs and to even disassociate themesleves from such false beliefs. The un-Islamic beliefs which we have quoted below are quotations from those individuals who possess such beliefs and by writing them in this handbill, we have no intention of Kufr.\nFALSE BELIEF 1: \"Allah can speak lies\". (\"Barahine Qaatia\" by Khaleel Ambetwi; \"Yakrozi\" by Ismaeel Dehlwi; \"Fatawa Rasheedia\" by Rasheed Ahmed Gangohi).\nANSWER: Lies is a defect which is not worthy of the Zaat of Almighty Allah and is totally Muhaal (Impossible) for Almighty Allah. Allah is free from all shortages and defects thus making lies Muhaal for Almighty Allah.\nFALSE BELIEF 2: \"The Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) had died and is mixed in the sand.\" (\"Taqweeyat-ul Imaan\" by Ismaeel Dehlwi).\nANSWER: It has been stated in the Hadith: \"Verily, Almighty Allah has made it Haraam upon the earth to eat the bodies of the Ambiya\". It has also been stated that Ambiya are alive and are blessed with Sustenance from Almighty Allah.\nFALSE BELIEF 3: \"Every creation, no matter how big or small, is equivalent to a cobbler before Allah.\" (\"Taqweeyat-ul Imaan\" by Ismaeel Dehlwi).\nANSWER: The Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is the most beloved Nabi of Almighty Allah. Almighty Allah took Qasm (Oath) even on the city of the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). He is the greatest of the creations of Almighty Allah. His every word is accepted in the Court of Allah. He is a perfection in the Attributes of Almighty Allah and Allah has not created any unique being besides Sayyiduna Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam).\nFALSE BELIEF 4: \"To think of an ox and donkey in Salaah is permissible, but to think of the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) in Salaah is Shirk (Polytheism).\" (\"Seerate Mustaqeem\" by Ismaeel Dehlwi).\nANSWER: For a Muslim to perform any Ibaadat accepting that it is a noble action of Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is the true sense of Ibaadat. If one reads Namaaz thinking of it as the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam), then, without doubt, one will think of the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). This belief creates in the mind of the performer the thought of the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Not only is the thought of the Prophet in Namaaz permissible, it is also the demand of Shari'ah that one must remember the Holy Prophet (salall laahu alaihi wasallam) at the time of Tasha'hud. According to the Fuqaha (Jurists) it is Waajib to believe that the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is observing you and that he is aware of your actions.\nFALSE BELIEF 5: Any person who says the Nabi to be Haazir and Naazir is a Kaafir. (\"Jawaahirul Quraan\" by Ghulaamullah Khan).\nANSWER: Until and unless we do not accept Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) as being Haazir and Naazir, the concept of Risaalat will be incomplete. Our Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is Shaahid, Mubashir and Nazeer.\nFALSE BELIEF 6: To commemorate the Meelad is like commemorating the function of the Hindu deity. (\"Baharine Qaatia\" by Khaleel Ambethwi).\nANSWER: Meelad is a means of gaining blessings and closeness to Almighty Allah. It is the practice of all the great predecessors. Many sources of Shari'ah are available to prove it's authencity. In fact, Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) observed fast on Monday as he was born on a Monday.\nFALSE BELIEF 7: If Allah wills, then he may create a million Muhammads. (\"Taqweeyatul Imaan\") A Prophet can even come after Muhammad (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). (\"Tahzeerun Naas\")\nANSWER: The doors of Prophethood have been sealed. Muhammad (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is the Seal of Prophethood. The Prophet also said that no Prophet shall come after him. Any person who claims Nabuwat after the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is a Liar, Dajjal Kazaab and a Shaitaan.\nFALSE BELIEF 8: \"Rahmatul Lil Alameen\" (Mercy unto the Worlds) is not a special title of the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam), but the Ummati are also \"Rahmatul Lil Alameen\". (\"Fatawa Rasheedia\")\nANSWER: \"Rahmatul Lil Alameen\" is the unique quality of Rasoolullah (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) as stated in the Holy Quran.\nNote: To believe all these above mentioned false \"Islamic\" beliefs makes one a hypocrite, and one is included in the ranks of the Shia, Rafazi, Khaarijite, Qadiani, Ghair-Muqallid (Ahle Hadith), Tabligi, Deobandi, Maudoodi, Ahle Quran (People of Quran), etc. which are totally out of Islam. Any person who falsely claims to be the true Mahdi is misguided and a Faasiq. Any person who says that Allah can lie, that the Prophet's (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) knowledge are like those of animals, that the Prophet Muhammad (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) is not the Final Messenger, that the swearing of the Sahaba does not make one a criminal, that the Prophet's knowledge is less than Shaitaan, etc. IS A KAAFIR (totally out of the folds of Islam). We should not perform Salaah or associate with such persons as their companionship is detrimental to our Imaan.",

          "paragraph": "In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful\nAssalaamu `alaykum waRahmatullahi Wabarakatuh\nAllah has blessed us with the finest of religions. Its purity will always remain. The reason for this is that Allah has preserved its sanctity from generation to generation right until this day. This was through the medium of those selected people whom Allah had chosen for the safeguarding and up keeping of his blessed religion. Allah has not given the understanding of his religion to everyone, rather he as only given it to those whom he wished.\nIt is imperative in our religion that we understand things in its context. By not doing so, one may gather a complete different meaning resulting him in being misguided. Not everything in the Quraan and Hadeeth are taken on its apparent meaning. For example, Allah mentions “then whosoever wills, let him believe and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve” (Al-kahf: 29). This verse apparently conveys the meaning that a person may believe or disbelieve. It is a choice given to him by Allah. However, Allama Ibn Katheer (Rahmatullah Alaih) in his commentary explains that this verse serves as a rebuke and warning to the people.\nSimilarly, this also applies in the sayings and literature of learned scholars. We should always understand things in its context. This is the underlying factor in all the so called “false beliefs” which you have taken from the website (www.islamicacdemy.com) and sent to us. They are not false beliefs; rather they are misunderstood by those who have commented on them.\nWe advise that you be cautious in the websites you browse and the information you accept. At times, incorrect information could create confusion. Be firm in your inclination towards Tabligh and always pray to Allah to keep you on the straight path.\nMay Allah guide us all Aameen\nAnd Allah knows best\nWassalamu Alaikum\nMl.

Abu Talib, the uncle of the Holy Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم had not embraced Islam, yet he continued to support and protect the Holy Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم throughout his life. The Holy Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم wished that his uncle would somehow recite the kalima and embrace Islam so he would be able to intercede on his behalf and he could have his deliverance from the punishment of Jahannam. When Abu Talib was on his death bed the Holy Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم was worried. He came close to him in that state of anxiety – but, Abu Jahl and Abdullah ibn Umayyah (disbelieving diehards) were already there. The Holy Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم asked his uncle to recite the kalima so he could seek forgiveness for him. But, Abu Jahl interrupted, would you forsake the faith of Abdul Muttalib. It was in this very condition that he died. Then the Holy Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم vowed that he would continue seeking forgiveness for him until he was prohibited from it. There upon, this verse of prohibition was revealed where the Holy Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and all Muslims were prohibited from praying for the forgiveness of kaafirs and mushriks even if they were close relatives. This put some Muslims into doubt. Was it not that Hadhrat Ibrahimعليه السلام too had prayed for his disbelieving father ? To answer it, the second verse (114) was revealed ( ... إِبْرَاهِيم وَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ ) In brief it means: as for the prayer made by Hadhrat Ibrahim عليه السلام for his father, it was conditioned by circumstances. In the beginning Hadhrat Ibrahim عليه السلام did not know that he would keep on persisting to his disbelief right through the end and would die a disbeliever. In other words, his going to hell was not certain."

The verses of the Quraan mentioning Hadhrat Ibrahim عليه السلام praying for the forgiveness of his father, should be taken in the sense that dua was made to Allah Ta’ala so that he may give him the Taufeeq of Imaan and Islam and that he may be forgiven."

The word Tarīqah linguistically means “manner” or “method” and in reference to the field of Tasawwuf, it refers to a school or order, e.g. the Chishtī Tarīqah, Naqshbandī Tarīqah, Shādhilī Tarīqah etc. Tariqah in relation to Tasawwuf is analogous to the word “madhhab” in relation to the schools of Fiqh. The science of Fiqh concerns itself with the external injunctions and regulations pertaining to things such as salāh, fasting, stealing, interest etc., and the science of Tasawwuf concerns itself with the internal injunctions and regulations pertaining to things such as praiseworthy qualities, e.g. gratefulness, patience, sincerity etc. and reprehensible qualities, e.g. pride, ostentation and greed etc."

Some Tarīqahs implement one set of spiritual exercises whilst other Tarīqahs implement a different set of exercises. Some differences in spiritual exercises stem from the differences of the Madhāhib of the Shuyūkh of each Tarīqah. Considering the fact that the Shuyūkh of Tasawwuf adhere strictly to the letter of the law, each Tarīqah will differ in exercises of dhikr as well. This will be discussed later. At present, it should suffice to understand that this science pertains to the abstract metaphysical internal element of the soul, thus there exists many seemingly unusual practices and exercises prescribed by the Shuyūkh to address such matters. These exercises were implemented to kindle the burning love of Allah in the heart cleansing it from the rust caused by the passions of the ephemeral Dunya and all that towards which the lower self calls. Dhikr is the nourishment and sustenance of the soul. Just as there are various types of food with varying nutritional benefits, similarly, the various types of dhikr prescribed by the Shuyūkh affect the spirit of a person in diverse ways. The field of Tasawwuf is usually likened to the field of medicine. Throughout history, man has discovered cures to various physical maladies, so to have the Shuyūkh, the spiritual doctors, discovered cures for spiritual maladies. Some of the practices and cures are mentioned in the Qur'ān, some in the Ahadīth, and others have been discovered through the institution of tajrubah (personal experience). Generation after generation, the Shuyūkh of Tasawwuf have dedicated their lives to this field, therefore, they know the effects of various adhkār upon the heart and soul. To those unfamiliar with Tasawwuf, such exercises may seem extremely peculiar and unusual. It is understandable for people to feel uncomfortable and queasy during their first experience with such exercises. However, to repel this discomfort, one should bear in mind that the Shuyūkh don’t claim that these adhkār and spiritual exercises are new forms of worship where it would be classified as an innovation (bid‘ah) in Dīn. Only those bereft of the understanding of Fiqh and the subtleties of Dīn make such professions. These spiritual prescriptions should be seen and regarded as a form of treatment (tadāwī) for the sicknesses of the heart. Just as the physical body must be put through certain therapeutic exercises for the benefit and rejuvenation of the body, so to do the Shuyūkh put the spiritual patient under various exercises to strengthen and treat the soul."

The next question that arises is to whom should one go in order to learn how to attain it. If a person goes to a Muhaddith, his field and preoccupation is to merely to tell the questioner whether the Hadīth is Sahīh, Hasan, Dha‘īf, how many chains of narration exist for the Hadīth, and which narrators transmitted the Hadīth etc. In regards to the meaning of the Hadīth, at best, they could offer only a literal translation. If a person goes to a Faqīh, he would only explain the various rulings that could be extracted from the Hadīth as it pertains to the external injunctions of the Sharī‘ah. The Faqīh too could not advise the questioner how to attain such a status nor the reality of such a position because such a question does not pertain to his field of expertise. If a person wants to learn the reality of this spiritual position and experience it, he will have to go to a person who has himself reached it. He will have to go to such a person who has dedicated his life in perfecting his internal attributes and character. Only that person who has already reached the destination can direct the lost seeker to it. To acquire this state, some of the Shuyūkh advise the Murīd to sit in solitude and absolute silence with full concentration and in a state of wudhū, whilst closing his eyes, constantly repeating and deeply pondering over the verse,"

On the contrary, it will not be permissible for the Shuyūkh and Murīds of the Hanafī Madhhab to participate in the dancing or swaying of the hadrah since no form of dancing is permitted in the Madhhab unless one is overtaken by an uncontrollable state of ecstasy. It is for this reason that the majority of Shuyūkh of the Ahnāf prescribe a different form of dhikr that produces the same result and effect as produced by the hadra. In the Chishti Tarīqah, the Shuyūkh prescribe loud dhikr of the Kalīmah, La Ilāha illa Allah where the Murīd sits and focuses his concentration on his heart with his head turned towards the direction of his heart. Then, with full devotion, absorption and zeal he recites La ilaaha (there is no deity) while moving his head towards the back and left intending thereby the negation and purging of everything other than Allah from the heart. Thereafter, with full vigor and force, he recites illa Allah (except Allah) while meditating that the love of Allah is flooding his heart. The similar effect of the hadra, namely, that of purification of the heart and spiritual vigor is thus produced which are some of the main ingredients for reviving the diseased heart."

Some of them feign being Sufis in order to gain fame and popularity, others to engage in singing and dancing and others to earn money etc. It is from such people that deviances began to crop up in this pristine and praiseworthy science. Examples of their innovations include the Qawāli where singing and music are rampant under the guise of Dhikr, grave-worship where people commit shirk by prostrating to the inmates of the grave, Salāmī where people stand up to offer salutations upon Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم with the belief that Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم visits the gathering and other similar practices that have no real connection with Tasawwuf. Because of the existence of such perfidious people and their impermissible practices, it has become a daunting task for sincere people such as you to find a true Shaykh and Tarīqah. Every Tarīqah has these imposters in their midst preying upon the ignorant masses; therefore, one must be cautious as to who one takes as a Murshid (guide). You should ensure that before taking formal bay‘ah to any Shaykh or entering into any Tarīqah, that the Shaykh is a complete adherent of the Sharī‘ah and upholds its dictates. Anyone who intentionally and openly breaks a single commandment of the Sharī‘ah is not worthy to be a Shaykh. A qualified Shaykh is he whose outward and inward appearance and actions conform to the Sunnah of Rasūlullah صلى الله عليه و سلم. A pious and righteous Shaykh is he in whose company a person feels the urge to act upon the dictates of the Sharī‘ah not disregard them. We advise you to continuously make du‘ā to Allah Ta‘ālā to guide you to a pious and upright Shaykh who will guide you in the field of Tasawwuf. You should make Mashwarah with pious local ‘Ulamā if any for their views on finding a genuine Shaykh. It is also important to understand that aside from the Shaykh being firm upon the Sharī‘ah, it is imperative that one have some congeniality with the Shaykh so that one can gain spiritual benefit from him. Without the existence of this congeniality and amiability, it will be difficult to consult with one’s Shaykh and follow his advices. Once you have found such a Shaykh who is strict in adherence to the Sharī‘ah and the Sunnah and you have an amicable relationship with him, you should place all your trust in him and follow all of his instructions without any doubt. Inshallah, in this manner you will ascend the stages of Tasawwuf with relative ease and obtain your objective."

But, What do you do if you have a grandmother that does nothing but start arguments and fights among husband and wife and is always trying to separate the husband and wife? And she says things to hurt feelings, and says such things to start fights even with children, like she doesn't spare any of the family members, but infront of other non-family members she acts so angelic, and complains oh my daughter in-law and her kids are so bad, and they did this to me and that to me etc etc..And not to mention she also does black magic..\nNow, my question is, does this type of woman still qualify to be a mother/grandmother? Is it legible to break all relations from her? Will her son/daughter get gunnah if they don't talk to her or listen to what she says(for ex: even all of the bad advice she gives to her son to do against his wife?)..And by all means, do we have to keep her in our house or can we refuse ? will we get gunnah if we refuse to keep her in our house, since she is our grandmother?",

He should inform them that his wife and children are suffering due to these occurrences. The children should then consult and devise a sound mechanism to avoid similar happenings in the future.

      "Question": "Brother, I am a practicing Muslim. I have a Christian colleague and a few days ago, he said that his computer was dead, and I jokingly said “Rest in peace” and made a cross on my chest, like Christians do. I know this was a ridiculous thing to do and I just did it without even thinking what I was doing, but later I realized that this can be devastating. I did istaghfaar and reiterated kalima. Did this action made me leave the folds of islam? Do I need to get my nikah done again? Please reply in detail as I am really worried.",

Wealthy men sometimes enter into a Misyaar marriage while on vacation especially to poor countries for example Egypt and Syria. Families agree to the arrangement because of the money and the hope that their girl will have some fun and visit places that she can only dream about (i.e. luxury hotels and restaurants). They also hope for some gifts at the end of the vacation and that the rich \"husband\" will give her some money and divorce her. Sometimes the husband keeps the wife for the next vacation and sends her some money now and then."

In Saudi Arabia 30 men and women aged between 20-40 were surveyed regarding Misyaar marriage. Over 60 percent of the men surveyed favoured Misyaar marriage with the majority of the respondents in their 20s."

      "Question": "i am a revert of 13 years and come from a non muslim upbringing. i am blessed to have the most loving, supportive parents who, through tolerance and open minds, allowed me to embrace islam at the age of 18.\ni have always had the belief that the Creator of all that exists is a loving and merciful God who much sooner forgives than punishes. sadly, i have met many muslims who condemn all non muslims to hellfire at a whim. these people take the standpoint that any person who is not a muslim belongs to the fire and have no chance of redemption in the sight of Allah. i am very aware of the meaning of shirk and how greatly Allah frowns upon it and with good reason. my point is this, not all christians believe that jesus (PBUH) is the son of Allah, or is Allah but they merely believe that he is the saviour who will come again and establish Allah's rule on earth. this is very much in line with the islamic belief in the last days.\nalso, there are people who are completely non religious but still believe in one god and who do not assign partners to Allah Most high. I just cannot in my heart accept that Allah will just throw everyone in hell because they were not muslim, although they believed in the basic tawheed that we muslims adhere to. every surah begins with bismilaah hir rahmaan hir raheem, Allah reminds us that He is the Merciful, the Benevolent.\nAre my parents doomed to etenal hellfire even though they lived good, decent lives, believed in one God, even allowed their son to become a muslim?

      "Question": "Your fatwa no. 5848 – a glorifying eulogy to Muhammad ibn Abdal Wahab\nmentions the views as held by the said individual. The following passage\nis of particular interest:\n“The Shaikh explained his views in regard to intercession and made it\nclear that he believed in the intercession of the Holy Prophet on the Day\nof Resurrection. Authentic books, such as 'Al-Tawassul wal-Wasila' by\nIbn-Taimiya and 'Ad-Dur an-Nadir'by Imaam Shawkaani, were also cited by\nhim. He finally quoted the Qur'anic verse: \"... Those whom you call on,\nthemselves desire nearness to Allah, which of them shall be nearer to\nAllah.? He further explained the Qur'anic injunctions in which Allah says\nthat all intercessions belonged to Him and He alone will grant permission\nfor intercessions. The Holy Prophet was granted the right to intercede.\nThe chapter on intercession in his \"Kitab at-Tawhid' is quite elaborate.\nIbn-Taimiya had divided intercession into six categories. The Shaikh also\ndiscussed the visit to the graves in the light of Ahadith. Ibn-Qayyim made\nan express statement in the following words: \"Among evil practices are\nusing them (tombs) as religious festivals, performing prayers in them,\nwalking round them, kissing them and touching them, rubbing the face\nagainst the dust, worshipping persons buried in them, making supplication\nto them and calling on them for sustenance, health, repayment of debts,\nalleviation of distress, aid to the needy, and other things such as\nidolaters used to ask their idols\"\n1. What were his views regarding ‘Wasilla’ through an individual who has\npassed away?\n2. Present-day salafis object to the common Muslim facing the grave of\nRasulullah [saw] and making dua [they seemingly tire, yet this practice is\nemphatically ceaseless]. Is it permissible to face the grave of Rasulullah\nand make dua?\n3. The article, with reference to graves, also points out the evil\npractices such as “kissing them and touching them, rubbing the face\nagainst the dust…” Is this not in contradiction to the famous and\nreverenced Qasida Burda Shareef wherein Imam Buseeri [ra] expreeses the\ndesire to the rub and kiss the dust of the Prophet’s [saw] grave?\n4. Does the Qur’aanic verse quoted in the passage above ‘those whom you\ncall on…’ refer to asking through the Wasilla of Nabi [saw], since the\ncontext of the discussion above is regarding the Wasilla of Nabi [saw]?",

The beliefs of the Jehovah’s Witnesses are against the beliefs of Islam, hence; by becoming a Jehovah’s Witness, he became a murtad (renegade).

Therefore, if a murtad regrets leaving the fold of Islam, repents sincerely and comes into the fold of Islam by reciting the Kalimah and exempting himself from all religions besides Islam, he will be treated as a normal Muslim and will enjoy all the rights that a common Muslim enjoys. It will not be permissible to treat him as a renegade or a non-Muslim after coming back into the fold of Islam."

The chain of narrators for this Hadith is totally different from the previous one. And in fact, Hafiz ibn Hajar [ra] has stated concerning a completely different narration which has the very same chain of narrators, that this chain of narrators is strong.

O Messenger of Allah, I have heard Almighty Allah say in the Qur'aan \"And if they, when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad Sallallahu alayhi wasallam) and begged Allah's forgiveness and the messenger had begged forgiveness for them, indeed they would have found Allah All-Forgiving.

If ones parents, Muslim or non-Muslims, are displeased with their child, that is the cause of the displeasure of Allah. In Islam, the mother’s role is three times more than a father. Our Prophet (May Peace be Upon Him) said, “Paradise lies beneath the feet of ones mother,” implying that ones eternal salvation lies in being respectful to ones mother. If you become a Muslim, it will be more important for you to care for your mother. Islam is a religion that promotes peace. You should endeavor for the peace and comfort of your mother.

The general masses do not differentiate between such fine issues.\nAnd Allah knows best\nWassalam\nMufti Ebrahim Desai\nDarul Iftaa"
